# Welcome to the list of MLAB modules 

### MLAB is an open-source electronic laboratory toolset. 

Each following repository contains a single hardware module from [MLAB.cz](https://www.mlab.cz/) system. The modules are partially split from [parent repository which contains all modules as submodules](https://github.com/MLAB-project/Modules) in the different organization [MLAB-project](https://github.com/MLAB-project). 
Feel free to fork, reuse and contribute to the improved designs.
